# Businessverse
Using HTML and CSS, I created this project from scratch.
While HTML is used to give the website context, CSS is used to style the website.
The website offers details about the business it is affiliated with, opportunities for users to sign up for the newsletter, and ways to get in touch with the business.
HTML tables are the basic foundation of this project.Table cells enclosed in rows and columns make up an HTML table. A opening and closing td  tag describe each table cell. Every table row has a opening and closing tr tag . The table's heading is provided by th tag and all the tags are enclosed within opening and closing table tag.
