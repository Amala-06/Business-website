# Businessverse
Using HTML and CSS, I created this project from scratch.
While HTML is used to give the website context, CSS is used to style the website.
The website offers details about the business it is affiliated with, opportunities for users to sign up for the newsletter, and ways to get in touch with the business.
HTML tables are the basic foundation of this project.Table cells enclosed in rows and columns make up an HTML table. A <td> and a </td> tag describe each table cell. Every table row has a <tr> and a </tr> tag at the beginning and end. The table's heading is provided by <th>and the tags that surround it all are provided by <table> and </table>.
